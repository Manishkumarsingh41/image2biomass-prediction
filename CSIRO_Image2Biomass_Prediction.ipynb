## Introduction
This notebook outlines the approach taken for the CSIRO Image2Biomass competition on Kaggle, where the goal is to predict biomass targets using image data.

---

## Stage 1: Data Loading & Preprocessing
```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Load data
data = pd.read_csv('data.csv')

# Preprocessing steps...
```

---

## Stage 2: Model Building (EfficientNetB0)
```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.applications import EfficientNetB0

# Build EfficientNetB0 Model
model = EfficientNetB0(weights='imagenet')
```

---

## Stage 3: Training & Evaluation with Weighted R² metric
```python
# Training and evaluation code...
```

---

## Stage 4: Inference & Submission generation
```python
# Inference code and create submission.csv...
```

---

## Stage 5: Visualization
```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
# Visualization code...
```

---

## Stage 6: Final Summary
This section summarizes the results achieved during the competition.

---

## Stage 7: Appendix Documentation
Further explanations and appendix of models, hyperparameters, etc.
